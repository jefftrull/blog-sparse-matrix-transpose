Supplements blog post by Karl Rupp:

## Build

Assuming that Boost is installed on the system, issue e.g.
 $> g++ main.cpp nothing.cpp -I. -O3 -DNDEBUG -o transpose


## Run

To run with a certain matrix size (e.g. 1000) and nonzeros per row (e.g. 10), pass them as parameters:
 $> ./transpose 1000 10


## Plot

Have a look at the results/ folder, where the data and gnuplot commands are located.
Replot via
 $> gnuplot plot.gnuplot
(produces postscript plots)

Convert to .pdf via
 $> epstopdf FILENAME.eps
and to .png using ImageMagick, e.g.
 $> convert -density 300 FILENAME.eps -resize 1150x FILENAME.png
